# Course Registration

## Add at least 3 Project features

* Can see course name in the cart.
* Can see total credit hour.
* Can see the description of the course.


## Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

* In my app's functionality, I declare three states. I then pass these states as props to the Credit component.
* Next, I receive the buttonHandler function in the Course component.
* Following that, I send another set of props from the Course component to the Courses component.
* Finally, I display the data in both the Courses component and the Credit component.
